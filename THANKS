- the stuff in socket.c is taken from the original AT&T unix vnciewer as are
  the files related to vnc-auth (d3des.c d3des.h and vncauth.c)

- the tight implementation is largely copied form the tight vnc distribution
  by Constantin Kaplinsky <const@ce.cctpu.edu.ru>

- A big thank you to the creators of the DirectFB library for their help and
  patience with my questions and suggestions. Denis Oliver Kropp and Andreas
  Hundt in particular.

- Also thanks to Yasin Taskin for rpm debugging and beta testing

- Ovidiu Damian did the debian infrastructure. Many thanks for that.

- Miguel Sofer <mig@utdt.edu> sent a patch moving endianess adjustment 
  calculations from runtime to compile time 

- Arnaud Launay <asl@launay.org> cleaned up the build process and helped 
  with releasing. Many thanks.
